### Higher Order Functions in JavaScript

Higher order functions in JavaScript are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results. Essentially, they treat functions as first-class citizens.


```
function higherOrderFunction(callback) {
    // Code to be executed before callback (if any)

    // Execute the callback function
    callback();

    // Code to be executed after callback (if any)
}

function callbackFunction() {
    // Code for the callback function
}

// Call the higher order function and pass the callback function
higherOrderFunction(callbackFunction);

```
#### Benefits:

- **Abstraction:** Higher order functions allow us to abstract over actions, making code more reusable and modular.
- **Flexibility:** They provide flexibility by allowing us to pass different functions as arguments or return different functions based on conditions.
- **Encourages Functional Programming:** Embracing higher order functions encourages a functional programming style, leading to cleaner and more expressive code.

#### Common Higher Order Functions in JavaScript:

- `map()`
- `filter()`
- `reduce()`
- `forEach()`
- `sort()`

These functions are commonly used in functional programming paradigms to perform operations on arrays or collections.


### Functions as Data
JavaScript functions behave like any other data type in the language; we can assign functions to variables, and we can reassign them to new variables.

In JavaScript, functions are first class objects. This means that, like other objects you’ve encountered, JavaScript functions can have properties and methods.

Since functions are a type of object, they have properties such as .length and .name, and methods such as .toString().

### Functions as Parameters
Parameter is a placeholder for the data that gets passed into a function. Since functions can behave like any other type of data in JavaScript, it might not surprise you to learn that functions can accept other functions as parameters. A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both! We call functions that get passed in as parameters callback functions. Callback functions get invoked during the execution of the higher-order function.


When we invoke a higher-order function, and pass another function in as an argument, we don’t invoke the argument function. Invoking it would evaluate to passing in the return value of that function call. With callback functions, we pass in the function itself by typing the function name without the parentheses
