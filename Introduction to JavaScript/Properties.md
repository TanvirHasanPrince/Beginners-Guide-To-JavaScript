## Properties in JavaScript
When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. All data types have access to specific properties that are passed down to each instance. 

For example, every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in that string. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name:

```Javascript
console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5


```
The . is another operator! We call it the dot operator.
