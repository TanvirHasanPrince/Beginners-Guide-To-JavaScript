## Arithmetic Operators in JavaScript

Arithmetic operators are used in JavaScript to perform mathematical calculations on numerical values. Here are the main arithmetic operators:

1. **Addition (+)**: Adds two operands together.

2. **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first operand.

3. **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two operands.

4. **Division (/)**: Divides the first operand by the second operand.

5. **Remainder (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.

6. **Exponentiation (**) (ES6)**: Raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

### Examples:

```javascript
var x = 10;
var y = 5;

var sum = x + y; // sum equals 15
var difference = x - y; // difference equals 5
var product = x * y; // product equals 50
var quotient = x / y; // quotient equals 2
var remainder = x % y; // remainder equals 0
var exponent = x ** y; // exponent equals 100000
