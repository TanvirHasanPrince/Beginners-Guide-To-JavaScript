## Methods in JavaScript
Methods are actions we can perform. Data types have access to specific methods that allow us to handle instances of that data type. JavaScript provides a number of string methods.

We call, or use, these methods by appending an instance with:

a period (the dot operator)
the name of the method
opening and closing parentheses
E.g. 'example string'.methodName().
