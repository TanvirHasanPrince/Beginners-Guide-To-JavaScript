## JavaScript Comments

In JavaScript, comments are used to annotate code with additional information for developers or to temporarily disable certain code blocks. Comments are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter during execution.

### Types of Comments

1. **Single-Line Comments**: Single-line comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line. They are often used for short explanations or annotations.

    ```javascript
    // This is a single-line comment
    var x = 5; // This comment explains the purpose of the variable assignment
    ```

2. **Multi-Line Comments**: Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span across multiple lines and are useful for longer comments or commenting out entire blocks of code.

    ```javascript
    /*
    This is a multi-line comment
    It can span across multiple lines
    */
    var y = 10;
    /*
    This block of code is commented out for testing purposes
    var z = 15;
    */
    ```

### Best Practices

- Use comments to explain complex logic, provide context, or document assumptions in your code.
- Write clear and concise comments that add value to the understanding of the code.
- Avoid excessive commenting on trivial or self-explanatory code.
- Regularly review and update comments to ensure they remain accurate and relevant as the code evolves.
