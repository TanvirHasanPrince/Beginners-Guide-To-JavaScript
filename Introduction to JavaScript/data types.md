## Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variables can hold values of any data type without explicitly specifying the type. JavaScript has the following primitive data types:

1. **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Examples: `5`, `3.14`.

2. **String**: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed within single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes. Examples: `'hello'`, `"world"`.

3. **Boolean**: Represents a logical value indicating true or false. Examples: `true`, `false`.

4. **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. It has the special value `undefined`.

5. **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any value. It has the special value `null`.

JavaScript also has the following complex data types:

6. **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Objects can be created using object literals `{}`, constructors, or the `new` keyword. Example: `{ name: 'John', age: 30 }`.

7. **Array**: Represents a collection of elements, where each element can be of any data type. Arrays are ordered, indexed collections. Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

8. **Function**: Represents a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can be defined using function declarations, function expressions, or arrow functions.

JavaScript also supports the concept of symbol, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), which represents a unique identifier.

Understanding these data types is essential for working effectively with JavaScript variables, manipulating data, and writing efficient code.
