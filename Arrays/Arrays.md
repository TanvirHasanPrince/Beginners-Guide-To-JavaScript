# Array

In JavaScript, arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They can hold various data types, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays. Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is accessed with an index of 0, the second with an index of 1, and so on.


### Accessing Elements
Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index. We can access individual items using their index

### Update Elements
Once you have access to an element in an array, you can update its value.

### Arrays with let and const
Variables declared with the const keyword cannot be reassigned. However, elements in an array declared with const remain mutable. Meaning that we can change the contents of a const array, but cannot reassign a new array or a different value.


### The .length property 
One of an arrayâ€™s built-in properties is length and it returns the number of items in the array. We access the .length property just like we do with strings.


### The .push() Method
.push(), allows us to add items to the end of an array. 

### The .pop() Method
Another array method, .pop(), removes the last item of an array.

### Shift()
shift(): This method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. The rest of the elements' indices are then shifted down accordingly.

### Unshift()
unshift(): This method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.


### Arrays and Functions


### Nested Arrays

Nested arrays are arrays within arrays, allowing for the creation of multidimensional arrays. They can be useful for representing data in a structured format, such as matrices, tables, or collections of objects with multiple properties.
