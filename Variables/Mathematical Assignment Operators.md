## Mathematical Assignment Operators

Letâ€™s consider how we can use variables and math operators to calculate new values and assign them to a variable.

In JavaScript, mathematical assignment operators are shorthand notations used to perform arithmetic operations and assign the result to a variable in a single step. These operators combine arithmetic operators with the assignment operator (=) to provide concise syntax.
 
 - Addition Assignment (+=)
 - Subtraction Assignment (-=)
 - Multiplication Assignment (*=)
 - Division Assignment (/=)
 - Remainder Assignment (%=)
 - Exponentiation Assignment (**=)
